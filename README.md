# Tahmid-s-ClickBrick-Hackpad-
Hi! I'm Tahmid, and this is my Hackpad submission for the Blueprint program.

For this project, I designed a custom macropad using the Seeed XIAO RP2040 DIP as the microcontroller. The macropad features eight Cherry MX switches with keycaps and an EC11 Rotary encoder switch.

Below is an overview image showing the completed macropad design:

I tried to keep everything simple and minimal, and I think it turned out pretty well.

Here’s a look at the schematic:

Next, here’s the PCB:

Now, let’s check out the case:

Here’s what you’ll need for the project:
1x SEEED XIAO RP2040-DIP
1x EC11 Rotary encoder switch
4x M3x16mm screws
8x Cherry MX switches
7x keycaps for the Cherry MX switches
